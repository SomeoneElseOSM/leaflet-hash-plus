# leaflet-hash-plus
Allows url hashes to represent and manipulate Leaflet map state

The ground work for this was initially done by [https://github.com/mlevans/leaflet-hash](https://github.com/mlevans/leaflet-hash). As the project has been abandoned for a number of years I have decided to see if I can bring it up to date with the more recent versions of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

I might finally learn what prototype does in JavaScript as well.
