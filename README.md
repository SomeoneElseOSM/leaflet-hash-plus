# leaflet-hash-plus
Allows url hashes to represent and manipulate Leaflet map state

The ground work for this was initially done by [https://github.com/mlevans/leaflet-hash](https://github.com/mlevans/leaflet-hash). That particular project hasn't received any commits since 2013 and so appears to be abandoned. As a result (and out of necessity) I have taken it upon myself to bring it up to date to support an expanded set of features and utilise the latest features of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
